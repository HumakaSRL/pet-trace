NEXT STEPS FOR REDESIGN

Homepage Wireframe/Mockup: • Use the chosen color palette, icons, and a professional but approachable style. • Emphasize the microchip search and registration CTAs.
Subtle Donation & Contact: • Decide final placement of donation button and add a “Contact Us” button for clinic partnerships.
Finalize Typography: • Since there’s no preset typeface, pick fonts that feel friendly yet professional.
Mobile-First Approach: • Start with a layout optimized for small devices and scale up.
SUMMARY OF THE VISION The homepage should instantly convey that Pet Trace is free, user-friendly, and trustworthy. It needs a standout microchip search bar and a clear path for registering pets. The vibrant, playful color palette reflects the spirit of caring for animals, while the structure remains professional to establish credibility. A subtle donation option is included but does not overshadow the main features. Over time, you can incorporate user testimonials or success stories to further build trust. This serves as the roadmap for an effective, appealing, and mobile-first homepage design.
