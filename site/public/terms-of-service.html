                <p>
                    Welcome to Pet Trace, a free service provided by Humaka SRL. By accessing or
                    using our website, you agree to comply with and be bound by the following terms
                    and conditions. If you do not agree with these terms, please refrain from using
                    the website. These terms may be updated periodically, so we encourage you to
                    review this page regularly to stay informed.
                </p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">1. Purpose of the Service</h3>
                <p>
                    Pet Trace is a platform designed to help identify lost pets using their
                    microchip serial number. Our goal is to provide an efficient and reliable way
                    for pet owners to track and reunite with their pets in case they go missing. The
                    service is free to use, and we are committed to ensuring that your pet data is
                    securely handled to improve tracking efforts.
                </p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">2. User Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>By using Pet Trace, you agree to the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Provide accurate, truthful, and up-to-date information about your pet,
                        including the correct microchip serial number.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ensure that all data entered about your pet is complete and valid.
                        Inaccurate or misleading information can reduce the effectiveness of the
                        service and hinder the chances of recovering lost pets.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Be responsible for keeping your pet's information updated in case any
                        details change (e.g., microchip status, owner's contact information).
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    By providing accurate pet data, you contribute to the safety and security of the
                    service, which relies on accurate records to track and identify pets that may go
                    missing.
                </p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">3. Free Service with Donations</h3>
                <p>
                    Pet Trace is completely free to use for all users. We rely on donations from
                    individuals and organizations to maintain and improve the service. If you find
                    value in our platform and wish to support its continued operation, you may
                    contribute via donations, but it is not required for using the service.
